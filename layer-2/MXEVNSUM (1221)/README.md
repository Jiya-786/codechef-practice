## \## Maximum Length Even Subarray

## You are given an integer 

## N

## N. Consider the sequence containing the integers 

## 1

## ,

## 2

## ,

## …

## ,

## N

## 1,2,…,N in increasing order (each exactly once). Find the maximum length of its contiguous subsequence with an even sum.

## 

## \## Input Format

## The first line of the input contains a single integer 

## T

## T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 

## T

## T test cases follows.

## The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer 

## N

## N.



## \## Output Format

## For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum length of a contiguous subsequence with even sum.
