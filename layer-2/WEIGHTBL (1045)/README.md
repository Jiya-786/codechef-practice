## \## Weight Balance

## 

## No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was 

## w

## 1

## w 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp; kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after 

## M

## M months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was 

## w

## 2

## w 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp; kg (

## w

## 2

## >

## w

## 1

## w 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp;>w 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp;).

## 

## Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between 

## x

## 1

## x 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp; and 

## x

## 2

## x 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp; kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Chef assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.

## 

## \## Input

## The first line of the input contains a single integer 

## T

## T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 

## T

## T test cases follows.

## The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers 

## w

## 1

## w

## &nbsp; and

## M.

##

## 1

## 0

## 0 if it cannot.
