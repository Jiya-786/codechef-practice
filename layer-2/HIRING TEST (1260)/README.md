## \##Hiring Test

## A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. 

## N

## N candidates appeared for the test, and each of them faced 

## M

## M problems. Each problem was either unsolved by a candidate (denoted by 'U'), solved partially (denoted by 'P'), or solved completely (denoted by 'F').

## 

## To pass the test, each candidate needs to either solve 

## X

## X or more problems completely, or solve 

## (

## X

## −

## 1

## )

## (X−1) problems completely, and 

## Y

## Y or more problems partially.

## 

## Given the above specifications as input, print a line containing 

## N

## N integers. The 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; integer should be 

## 1

## 1 if the 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; candidate has passed the test, else it should be 

## 0

## 0\.

## 

## \##Input:

## The first line of the input contains an integer 

## T

## T, denoting the number of test cases.

## The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, 

## N

## N and 

## M

## M, denoting the number of candidates who appeared for the test, and the number of problems in the test, respectively.

## The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, 

## X

## X and 

## Y

## Y, as described above, respectively.

## The next 

## N

## N lines contain 

## M

## M characters each. The 

## j

## t

## h

## j 

## th

## &nbsp; character of the 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; line denotes the result of the 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; candidate in the 

## j

## t

## h

## j 

## th

## &nbsp; problem. 'F' denotes that the problem was solved completely, 'P' denotes partial solve, and 'U' denotes that the problem was not solved by the candidate.

## 

## \##Output:

## For each test case, print a single line containing 

## N

## N integers. The 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; integer denotes the result of the 

## i

## t

## h

## i 

## th

## &nbsp; candidate. 

## 1

## 1 denotes that the candidate passed the test, while 

## 0

## 0 denotes that he/she failed the test.
