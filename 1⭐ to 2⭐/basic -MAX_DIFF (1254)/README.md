## \## The Two Dishes

## Chef prepared two dishes yesterday. Chef had assigned the 

## tastiness

## tastiness 

## T

## 1

## T 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp; and 

## T

## 2

## T 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp; to the first and to the second dish respectively. The tastiness of the dishes can be any 

## integer

## integer between 

## 0

## 0 and 

## N

## N (both inclusive).

## 

## Unfortunately, Chef has forgotten the values of 

## T

## 1

## T 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp; and 

## T

## 2

## T 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp; that he had assigned to the dishes. However, he remembers the sum of the tastiness of both the dishes - denoted by 

## S

## S.

## 

## Chef wonders, what can be the maximum possible absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes. Can you help the Chef in finding the maximum absolute difference?

## 

## It is guaranteed that at least one pair 

## {

## T

## 1

## ,

## T

## 2

## }

## {T 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp;,T 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp;} exist such that 

## T

## 1

## \+

## T

## 2

## =

## S

## ,

## 0

## ≤

## T

## 1

## ,

## T

## 2

## ≤

## N

## T 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp;+T 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp;=S,0≤T 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp;,T 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp;≤N.

## 

## \## Input Format

## The first line of input contains a single integer 

## T

## T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the 

## T

## T testcases follows.

## The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 

## N

## N, 

## S

## S, denoting the maximum tastiness and the sum of tastiness of the two dishes, respectively.



## \## Output Format

## For each testcase, output a single line containing the maximum absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes.
