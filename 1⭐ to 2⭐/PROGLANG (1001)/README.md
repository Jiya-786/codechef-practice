## Chef is a software developer, so he has to switch between different languages sometimes. Each programming language has some features, which are represented by integers here.

## 

## Currently, Chef has to use a language with two given features 

## A

## A and 

## B

## B. He has two options --- switching to a language with two features 

## A

## 1

## A 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp; and 

## B

## 1

## B 

## 1

## ​

## &nbsp;, or to a language with two features 

## A

## 2

## A 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp; and 

## B

## 2

## B 

## 2

## ​

## &nbsp;. All four features of these two languages are pairwise distinct.

## 

## Tell Chef whether he can use the first language, the second language or neither of these languages (if no single language has all the required features).

## 

## \## Input Format

## The first line of the input contains a single integer 

## T

## T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 

## T

## T test cases follows.

## The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers 

## A

## \## Output Format

## For each test case, print a single line containing the integer 

## 1

## 1 if Chef should switch to the first language, or 

## 2

## 2 if Chef should switch to the second language, or 

## 0

## 0 if Chef cannot switch to either language.
