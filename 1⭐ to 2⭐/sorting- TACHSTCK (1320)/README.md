## \## Chopsticks

## 

## Actually, the two sticks in a pair of chopsticks need not be of the same length. A pair of sticks can be used to eat as long as the difference in their length is at most D. The Chef has N sticks in which the ith stick is L\[i] units long. A stick can't be part of more than one pair of chopsticks. Help the Chef in pairing up the sticks to form the maximum number of usable pairs of chopsticks.

## 

## \## Input

## The first line contains two space-separated integers N and D. The next N lines contain one integer each, the ith line giving the value of L\[i].

## 

## \## Output

## Output a single line containing the maximum number of pairs of chopsticks the Chef can form.
